## CAN NEURAL NETWORKS BEAT ENGINEERED FEATURES AT DETECTING ALERT FROM DROWSY STUDENTS?

This is the code repository accompanying my Individiual Research Project which is part of the
Cognitive Systems Master at University of Potsdam.

I will be using a dataset comprised of eye closure signal of students in a baseline or sleep
deprived setting. Using the eye closure signal I want to compare the quality of engineered features
with the quality of features learnt by neural networks during training. The quality of the features
is quantified by their power to predict upcoming events related to drowsiness.
